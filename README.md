## Gradle Setup üêò

This template is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the [Dependencies.kt](buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt) file in the `buildSrc` folder. This provides convenient auto-completion when writing your gradle files.

## Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) with the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This template is also using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/AbdElraoufSabri/android-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `build`, `check` and `publishToMavenLocal` tasks. 

## Publishing üöÄ

The template is setup to be **ready to publish** a library/artifact on a Maven Repository. If you're using JitPack, you don't need any further configuration and you can just configure the repo on JitPack. If you're using another repository (MavenCentral/JCenter/etc.), you need to specify the publishing coordinates.

## Contributing ü§ù
